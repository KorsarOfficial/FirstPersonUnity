Note If you do not want to make a mistake, then I highly recommend sticking to the exact execution of tasks to avoid compilation errors. See the screenshots.

1. Move the FPSmove.cs script to the model of the object you are going to control (in my case, it is a capsule), set it a collider so that it does not fall through the textures.
the script describes which line is responsible for what if you suddenly want to change something.

2. Move the FPScamera.cs script to the camera and move it to the player model.

3. Create a Ground tag and move the tag to the floor, walls, etc

4. Test it. You should be able to do it. If you have an error, then you should review the screenshots and re-read the information.
